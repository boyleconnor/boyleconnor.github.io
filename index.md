I am Connor Boyle, a research programmer at [Information Sciences Institute][17]
and a graduating M.S. student in Computational Linguistics at the
University of Washington. At ISI, I work under Marjorie Freedman on the [LESTAT][18]
project. At UW, I've worked with [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/)
as part of [Noah's Ark](https://noahs-ark.github.io/). I have also worked
with [Thomas Schaffter](https://cd2h.org/index.php/node/124) on [NLP Sandbox][1].

## Current Projects

### NLP Sandbox

[NLP Sandbox][1] is an NLP tool benchmarking project for medical notes. NLP
Sandbox allows data sites (hospitals and universities) to securely run and
evaluate containerized NLP tools on their private datasets. NLP Sandbox
currently supports two named-entity recognition tasks: named-entity recognition
(NER) for patient personal information ([PHI][2]) & COVID-19 symptoms.

## Past Projects

### NL-Augmenter

[NL-Augmenter][9] is a collaborative project to create transformations and
filters for augmenting and processing natural language datasets; it was created
as an [ACL 2021 workshop][13]. I contributed [two][10] [transformations][11]
and [one filter][12], as well as multiple bugfixes to the core codebase of the
project. A co-authored paper is forthcoming.

### Cartograph

[Cartograph][14] ([source][15]) is an interactive semantic-relatedness map of
Wikipedia articles. The maps are created by generating high-dimensional vectors
representing hyperlinks between Wikipedia articles, then projecting these
vectors into 2D space using T-SNE. I contributed to the development of
Cartograph as an NSF grant-funded undergraduate research assistant to its
creator, [Shilad Sen][16].
